	abstract = {We extend a previous access control solution for wireless network services with group-based authorization and encryption capabilities. Both the basic solution and this novel extension focus on minimizing computation, energy, storage and communications required at sensors so they can be run in very constrained hardware, since the computations involved rely on symmetric cryptography and key derivation functions. Furthermore, no additional messages between users and sensors are needed. Access control is based on user identity, group membership and time intervals.},
