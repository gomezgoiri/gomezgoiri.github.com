class: center, middle

# Motivation
<!--## (1/6)-->

---

# Motivation

 1. Space-based computing
 1. Ubiquitous computing (UbiComp)

<img alt="UbiComp and Space based computing" src="img/ubicomp_space.svg" style="width: 100%; display: block; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" />

???

I'm not talking about the pragmatic motivation, which is to get a PhD ;-)

2 fields influenced me.

---

# Space-based computing
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

 * Space uncoupling
 * Time uncoupling

<img alt="Space based computing: rd, in and out primitives" src="img/spacebasedcomp.svg" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" />

???

* Benefits
  * You can __substitute__ devices in the space
  * You don't need to __reconfigure__ them
* Ideal for environments which __change__ / are __dynamic__
  * in the short and long term

---

<!-- Molaría más tener un supertítulo en pequeño para que se notase que sigo en la motivation -->
# UbiComp
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

Devices imperceptibly working on our behalf.

 * Its real power "_comes not from any one of these devices, it emerges from the __interaction__ of all of them_".
 * The Internet of Things and mobile computing.

???

UbiComp is a term __coined__ by Mark Weiser (in the early nineties).

Lately: IoT & mobile comp. __contributed to this vision__.

## Problem
Devices and applications build upon them are heterogeneous.

---

# Interoperability
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

The IEEE defines it as

 > The ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information
 > and to use the information that has been exchanged. <!-- TODO cite -->
 
---

<img alt="Interoperability: exchange and use" src="img/interoperability.svg" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" />


???
1. Exchange
 * We rely on widely accepted communication protocols (interop __ab-initio__)
2. Use
 1. __Syntactic__ level: format of the data (i.e. its syntax and encoding)
 1. __Semantic__ level: precise meaning of the info
    * _"understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose"_ <!-- TODO cite -->

# The Semantic Web
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]


 > .weak[The vision of the Semantic Web is to extend principles of the Web from documents to data.
 > Data should be accessed using the general Web architecture using, e.g., URI-s;
 > data should be __related to one another__ just as documents (or portions of documents) are already.
 > This also means creation of a common framework that allows data
 > to be __shared and reused__ across application, enterprise, and community boundaries,
 > to be __processed automatically__ by tools as well as manually,
 > including revealing possible __new relationships__ among pieces of data.]

???

After analyzing these research areas...

Space-based computing:

* Often applied to UbiComp
* Used with Semantics

Usually centrallizing so...

I made myself a question (research question, PhD opportunity)

* Can these devices get __more involved__ in the management of the space?
  * Not only mere clients

* Semantic in limited devices __Overhead__?
  * Many of the current devices are able to manage their info
    * Even if it is more verbosed
    * Some of them can reason and expand this information.
    * Others may need to rely in third machines.
      * Out of the scope
  * Anyway, we might be anticipating a trend.

Let me sketch some of this points in the remaining minutes.
 
For the sake of time, I omit the 3rd one and explain the rest summarized.

# Space model

???

This is __simplified version__ of all my unfruitful attempts.

---

# Baseline Model
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

Triple Space Computing (TSC)
 
 * Spaces identified by URIs
 * Tuples == RDF Triples & RDF Graphs
 * Templates = triple patterns

<div style="margin-top:2em;" />

![Resources in TSC](img/tsc_resources.svg)
 
???

Uses elements from the SW

---

# 1st attempt
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

Completely __decentralized__

 * Each device manages its own information
 * It asks to the rest using a __P2P__ approach

???

I did this prior to knowing that I wanted to be a PhD student.

Benefits:

* Reduces __dependency__ on others
  * each device manages its own knowledge
  * this simplifies the __management__
* Reduces networking in __writings__
  * Which are quite frequent (updates of a sensor measure)

Drawbacks:

* Flooding-based __search__: networking
* __Inconsistency__ (Brewer)
* __JXTA__: not really interoperable
 
  * Not appropriate for limited devices
  * Discontinued
  * A nightmare!

# 2nd attempt (I)
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

Same model, we substituted the _communication mechanism_

???

To interoperate, it is better to adopt a __widely accepted__ mechanism.

<!-- Mechanism/protocol -->
--

background-image: url(img/the_web.svg)

<h2 style="margin-top:5em;">the Web!</h2>]

???

Even this presentation is part of the web!

(at least, it is running in a web browser and it will be uploaded afterwards ;-))

---
 
# Why the Web?
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

 * Massively accepted <!--by humans.-->
 * A lot of applications expose their capabilities using HTTP APIs
--

 * __REST__ architectural style comprises the design principles of _the modern web_

<!--  Dibujito o tabla para que se intuya? -->

???

 Properties achieved:
 
  * Scalability
  * Simplicity
  * Portability
  * etc.
 
 They are useful for limited devices!
 
--

 * Actually, it has been widely applied to IoT: the __Web of Things__
 
 * Conflicts: push approach, subscription mechanisms...

# 2nd attempt (II)
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

HTTP API for TSC:

 * __Resource oriented__: spaces, RDF Graphs, RDF triples
 
 * HTTP __verbs__ mapped to TSC __primitives__
 
 * Other features: status codes, content negotiation, etc.
 
 * It is not hypermedia driven (yet)

<!--enumerar los principios que cumple-->

???

As part of this 2nd attempt... we made an HTTP API

TSC interface for HTTP compatible with (most of) the REST principles.

HATEOAS: future work.

* Although it has a human oriented API


Drawbacks not mentioned yet:

 * subscription, transactions, etc. vs stateless

# Problem with the 1st and 2nd attempts
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

What about the uncoupling?
 
 
 <img alt="Space and time" src="img/uncoupling.svg" style="width:90%; margin-top: 2em; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"" class="center" />

<span style="margin-left: 1.4em;">Space uncoupling <span style="color: #4db849; font-size: 2em; vertical-align: middle;">&#10004;</span></span>
???

* Programmers only care about data (__forced__ by the primitives)

--

<span style="float:right;">Time uncoupling <span style="color: #e53f39; font-size: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle;">&#10060;</span></span>

???

* Provider holds its content...
  * only accessible when the provider is available
* __Move contents__ to other nodes
  * how to distinguish the reliable ones?
  * measures away from where they are generated
   * what if the other node lefts the space but the provider is available?
* Replicate contents
  * more networking
  * not easy (unreliable => networking)
* __Complex__

---

# Final model
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

We realized that we used the space for different purposes:

 1. Search for information
 1. Coordinate through the space

???

__Time__ uncoupling particularly __important for coordination__

* No so much for search (real time)

--

<img alt="Proposed dual model" src="img/new_model.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

<!-- A modo de evaluación o conclusión, poner una tabla con las propiedades -->

???

<hr />

Based on our __experience__.

Hence, we propose a __dual model__.

* Coordination space
 * Enhanced by the information provided by autonomous devices
* Outer space:
 * __Enriched view__
 * what's happening on __real time__

# Evaluation: Energy consumption

<img alt="Energy consumption for each type of activity" src="img/energy_consumption.svg" style="width: 90%;" />

???
 
1. __Improve__ the search, become it smarter 
1. Move the __management tasks__ created by our proposal __to__ more __powerful__ devices

---

class: center, middle

<img alt="Energy-aware search architecture" src="img/architecture.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

???

1. Different __roles__
1. Providers
1. Consumers: directly request/query providers
 * Which ones?
1. Clues or indexes
 * __Light__ example (measures, lamp)
1. WP to enhance the search
 * WP chosen __dynamically__: considering energy consumption and computation
  * changes over the time
 * Consumers __don't depend__ on the WP to resolve the queries
  * Just to get and update the clues

---

# Evaluation: Network activity

<img alt="Requests generated using different strategies" src="img/requests_by_strategies.svg" style="width: 90%;" />

???

* Better than floading
* Comparing to caching: depends on the # of providers and the # of queries

---

# Evaluation: Network activity (by device type)

<img alt="Energy consumption for each class" src="img/activity_measures.svg" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10%;" />

???

* On average, __activity is reduced__ considerably
* Besides,
 * less requests on the limited devices
 * additional tasks, moved to more powerful ones

# Conclusion

---

# Conclusion

 * __Mix the best__ of two worlds: space-based computing and the web.
  * Uncoupling
  * Scalability, simplicity...
 * __Energy__-aware search
 
 * __Future__ work:
  * Performance evaluation in real deployments over a long period of time, with many different applications running
  * Security aspects
  * Distribution of the coordination space
  * Etc.
