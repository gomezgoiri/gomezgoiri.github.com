# {{ page.title }}

Since I first heard about [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) in my [student times](http://www.e-ghost.deusto.es/), I have always been interested in it.
I am a supporter of this community and its philosophy.

As a way to give back part of what I have received, I have given some talks but more importantly I have contributed to open-source projects as often as my research has allowed me.

Instead of simply putting a link to my [GitHub account](https://github.com/gomezgoiri), in this section I will discuss some of the most interesting projects that I have made.
For a more research-oriented view of my work, please visit the [R&amp;D section](research_projects.html).

[Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/about-networking-academy/packet-tracer/) is a network simulation tool created by [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/).
As part of the [FORGE project](forge.html), I developed a web version/frontend for it.

During the following articles, I will guide you through the features I developed for it:

 1. Installation
 1. Web widget
 1. HTTP API
 1. Internal API
