In the beginning researchers created the Internet.

Internet was composed by few computers.

Consequently, more and more computers got connected.

<img alt="The Internet of Things appears" src="img/transpas/internet05.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

Nowadays, __not only__ a wider range of smartphones, but also everyday objects like cars or washing machines connect to the Internet to exchange information.

This is what __is know as__ the Internet of Things (IoT).

<img alt="Guy reading the news while his home works on his behalf" src="img/transpas/ubicomp01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

Both the IoT and the mobile computing have __contributed to Ubicomp__.

UbiComp is a term __coined__ by Mark Weiser (in the early nineties).

It describes environments where devices imperceptibly work on our behalf.

<img alt="Devices work together" src="img/transpas/ubicomp02.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

But, in Mark's words, UbiComp's real power "comes not from any one of these devices, it emerges from the __interaction of all__ of them".

This interaction brings __challenges__ to UbiComp.

In this thesis I've  focused on two of them.

## Introduction

<img alt="Guy reading the news while his home works on his behalf" src="img/transpas/ubicomp01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

First, we have the dynamism.

This dynamism has its effects both in the short and the long term.

Since most devices have a mobile nature, they can come and go frequently in the short term.

# UbiComp, challenge 1: proposed solution
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]
<img alt="Space based computing: rd, in and out primitives" src="img/transpas/space-based.png" style="width: 100%;">

???

Space-based computing (or Tuple Spaces) faces this dynamism successfully.

Tuple Spaces is a paradigm where nodes coordinate with each other by writing and reading structured pieces of information (i.e., tuples) in a shared space.

This paradigm can be uncoupled in space and in time.

__Space uncoupling__ is achieved because the nodes don't need to know each other beforehand to communicate.

That is, TS' primitives do not care about addresses and references, they just care about the content which is being shared.

__Time uncoupling__ is achieved because two nodes communicating with each other do not need to coexist at the same time.

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

<img alt="Dude, what are you talking about?" src="img/transpas/interoperability01.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

The second challenge UbiComp has to face is that both the devices and the applications build upon them are heterogeneous.

This means that the interoperability is a key property for these environments.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity

The [IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=2238) defines __interoperability__ as

# UbiComp, challenge 2: heterogeneity

The [IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=2238) defines __interoperability__ as

> .weak[The ability of two or more systems or components to _exchange_ information
> and to __use__ the information that has been exchanged.]

???

So, let's first talk about the second problem: how to use (or reuse) information.

---

# UbiComp, challenge 2a: use info
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

<img alt="The robot does not understand chinese or japanese" src="img/transpas/interoperability02.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

We can identify two levels to allow this __use__:

 1. The  __syntactic__ level, which cares about  the format of the data (i.e. its syntax and encoding)
    * For instance, if the robot does not undestand chinese characters, the information the mobile phone provides will be useless.

 1. The __semantic__ level gives a precise meaning to the information...
    * _"understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose"_ <!-- TODO cite -->
    * Following the example, this character may mean different things depending on the context (and it does actually).

---


# UbiComp, challenge 2a: proposed solution
.subtitle[
## Introduction
]

<img alt="The robot does understand terms" src="img/transpas/interoperability03.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

To achieve both levels, I propose to use __Semantic Web__ standards and tools.

The __vision__ of the Semantic Web is to extend principles of the Web from documents to data.

It proposes to relate terms to one another, so they can be shared and reused across applications.

This terms can be processed automatically revealing new relationships among the data.

 > .weak[The __vision__ of the Semantic Web is to extend principles of the Web from documents to data.

# UbiComp, challenge 2b:  exchange info

The [IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=2238)  defines _interoperability_ as

???

The other aspect which affects the interoperability is __how to exchange information__.

To interoperate, it is better to adopt a __widely accepted__ communication mechanism. <!-- mechanism/protocols -->
This is called interop __ab-initio__.

And what's more accepted today than...

<img alt="The web is widely accepted" src="img/transpas/web_accepted01.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

The web is massively accepted <!--by humans. (this is not a real reason) -->

 * By humans
 * But also, by machines: a lot of applications expose their capabilities using HTTP APIs

__REST__ architectural style comprises the design principles of _the modern web_

It achieves the following properties  (see Fielding's thesis)

* Scalability
* Simplicity
* Portability
* etc.

Note that most of these properties are particularly useful for limited devices.

<img alt="The web of Things" src="img/transpas/wot.png" style="width: 100%; display: block;">

???

As a consequence, the web has been widely applied to IoT, bringing what people has called the __Web of Things__ (WoT).

<!-- Transpa backup: WoT challenges: push approach, subscription mechanisms... -->

In the WoT, everyday things expose their capabilities through web standards.
This way, they are first-class web citizens and can seamlessly work with other web apps.

This goes hand in hand with my interest in having devices which are not mere clients, but also active data providers.

Summarizing, I propose to face UbiComp dynamism using space-base computing.

To tacke the heterogeneity, I propose to use

* the web to exchange information and
* the semantic web standards to make it reusable

# State-of-the-art

<!-- TODO Delimit the scope in this section or in the next one? -->

<img alt="Scope of the dissertation" src="img/transpas/venn_background.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

<!-- Aprovecho esta ptranspa para hacer una pasada superficial al estado del arte -->

After analyzing these research areas in the UbiComp domain I saw that...

Space-based computing

 * has often been applied to UbiComp
 * and it has also been used with Semantics (I focus on Triple Space Computing paradigm or TSC), <!-- Necesario porque luego lo nombro en la hipotesis -->
 * but usually centrallizing the space on powerful devices.

This is also common in most of the systems which use the Semantic Web in UbiComp.

# Common design: delegate semantic provision
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision01.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

So, one popular design solution when working with limited devices is to centralize all the knowledge in a more powerful machine (or machines).

For sake of clarity, let's assume that there is just one machine.

This way, the devices periodically send their information to this machine,
and it stores all the information.

---

# Common design: delegate semantic provision
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision02.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

Whenever a limited device needs to query for something, it has to ask to this machine.

---

# Common design: delegate semantic provision
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision03.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

The reasons to do this are mainly two:

 1. semantic processing can add too much overhead to limited devices
 2. it is hard to ensure the information availability with unsteady (too dynamic) devices

However,

 1. Availability is not always a requirement. In fact, the unavailability, "represents" the mobile nature of the environment/space.
 1. Current embedded and mobile devices are notably more powerful than 5 years ago

And, now, let me do a brief parenthesis to talk about this...

---

# "Short" or "limited" are relative adjectives <!-- IoT? Energy-aware? -->
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/dunk-portrait-2006.jpg" class="center" style="width: 20em;"/>
<!-- Explain: which devices, results for semantic web testings, the evolution experienced since I first started working in this -->

???

The player in the center is Nate Robinson who, compared to any of the remaining NBA players will be considered small.

However, he is about 4 cm taller than me, so I wouldn't consider him small.

The same thing happens when we speak about _limited devices_.

In the context of my dissertation, _limited devices_ are mobile or embedded devices able to manage semantic annotations.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision04.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

So, after this parenthesis, let's return to the delegation of semantic provision and management from limited to more powerful devices.

This design has two problems.

[RESPIRAR y LEER ANTES  que viene frase larga]

First, when devices rely on others to provide information, it is not guaranteed
that the information accessed will accurately represent the last information
available in the data providers.

In the example, we see a limited device (e.g, a sensor) with a version of its contents created at _t3_.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision05.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

It sends its contents to a server.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision06.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

This server stores this version.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision07.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

Afterwards, the sensor generates a new version with new measures at t6.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision08.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

It is obvious that if other device now askes for the content provided by this sensor to the server...

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 1
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision09.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

...it will get the outdated version.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 2
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/centralized_provision10.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

The second problem happens because once devices rely on intermediaries,
these intermediaries must be available at all time.
Otherwise, the devices would not be able to talk to each other.

Note that,

 * Having dedicated servers is costly and hard to manage in simple scenarios
 * Externalizing these servers, makes you system dependant on third-parties.

And this happens way too frequently on the Internet.

---

# Delegation of semantic provision: Problem 2
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/navaztag.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"p/>

???

For example, the Navastag was an IoT device which was completely depent on an external service.

The company of this internet-connected bunny dissapeared and they did not maintain the servers.
<!-- They released a poorly documented code. -->

As a consequence, nowadays the Navastag is pretty much an expensive decoration.


So, with these considerations in mind, I made myself a question:
<!-- research question => PhD opportunity -->

 * Can these devices get __more involved__ in the management of the space?
   Not only as mere clients.

   
To sum up these interests, I made the following hypothesis.

(__ATENCION__: calmate y lee esto lentamente)

---

# Hypothesis

# Goals

 1. Space model
 2. Search architecture
 3. Actuation mechanism

???
To validate the hypothesis, the main objective of this dissertation was _to design a middleware which follows the TSC paradigm_

* according to web principles
* and considering the energy and computation aspects.

<hr>

This objective can be achieved through the following sub-goals:

1. Merge the benefits from Space-based computing and the web in a __new space model__.
1. Add searching capability to this model, and
1. Define how to actuate using it.

???
First, let's talk about the space model.

Note that at the bottom there are some articles I published regarding this issue.
---

# Space model

<img alt="Proposed dual model" src="img/new_model.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

Analysis:

 * Networking properties
 * Coordination properties
 * Is it for limited devices?

???

After several attempts, I came up with the __dual model__ shown in the figure.

It is composed by:

 * Coordination space
  * which is pretty much a classical semantic space
  * enhanced by the information provided by autonomous devices (or asteroids) which are part of the
 * Outer space
  * This OS is an __enriched view__ of
  * what's happening on __real time__

This model confines much of the information in the devices.

I analysed this model from different perspectives.

To analyse its networking properties, we must note that both spaces are accessed through their APIs.

---

# Networking properties

<img alt="TSC is resource oriented and matches with HTTP verbs" src="img/transpas/networking_properties01.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

Both APIs are based on the space-based computing primitives, which are compatible with (most of) the REST principles:

* The API is resource oriented. It has the following types of resources: spaces

<img alt="TSC is resource oriented and matches with HTTP verbs" src="img/transpas/networking_properties03.png" style="width: 100%;" />

which contain RDF triples.

The triples are the most basic information unit in Triple Space Computing.

---

<img alt="TSC is resource oriented and matches with HTTP verbs" src="img/transpas/networking_properties04.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

* The API's TSC primitives can be directly mapped to HTTP verbs
* Furthermore, we take advantage of other HTTP features such as
 * status codes or the
 * content negotiation.

---

# Networking properties
.subtitle[
##  Space model
]

<img alt="The API is not hypermedia-driven" src="img/transpas/networking_properties05.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

Unfortunately, these APIs are not hypermedia-driven.

In short, this principle means that the client should not __know__ anything apart from an __URL__ to use an API.

It should drive the interaction __selecting the new application states__ from the web hypermedia content provided by the server at each step.

Although, the API is actually hypermedia-driven for humans, it is not for machines.

---

# Networking properties
.subtitle[
##  Space model
]

REST-like APIs

* Scalability
* Simplicity
* User perceived performance
* Efficiency
* Evolvability

???

Anyway, accessing to the spaces through a REST-like API provides the following features to our model:

* Scalability (4+)
* Simplicity (3+-)
* UP performance, efficiency & evolvability (2+)
* and some other properties [avoid enumeration]
 * Portability, extensibility, configurability, reusability & reliability (+)
 * Visibility (+-)
 * Net performance (-)

And it also comes with some drawbacks:

* Less simplicity, reusability & visibility than pure REST APIs and
* that Mechanisms such as subscriptions and transactions go against REST architecture's statelessness

<img alt="Space and time" src="img/uncoupling.svg" style="width:60%; margin-top: 2em; display: block; margin-left: 12em; margin-right: auto"/>
<div style="margin-top: 1em;">
 <span style="margin-left: 12em;">Space uncoupling</span>
 <span style="float:right;">Time uncoupling</span>
</div>

???

But, having a part of the model which is based on the web also affects uncoupling.

--

<div>
 <span style="float:left;">Coordination space</span>
 <span style="width: 20em; float:right;">
     <span style="margin-left: 25%; color: #4db849; font-size: 2em; vertical-align: middle;">&#10004;</span>
     <span style="margin-left: 40%; color: #4db849; font-size: 2em; vertical-align: middle;">&#10004;</span>
  </span>
</div>

???

Obviously, the coordination space corresponds with the clasical model and therefore has both uncoupling levels.

---

      <span style="margin-left: 25%; color: #4db849; font-size: 2em; vertical-align: middle;">&#10004;</span>
???

In the _outer space_, programmers are forced by space-based primitives not to care about data too.

--
      <span style="margin-left: 40%; color: #e53f39; font-size: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle; font-weight: bold;">X</span><!-- &#10060; <- Not recognized in Win7-->
  </span>
</div>

???

However, regarding _time uncoupling_, since each provider holds its content, this is only accessible when the provider is available.

[__ENFATIZAR__]

I kept a time coupled outer-space because I identified (realized) that we used the space for two different purposes:

 1. Search for information
 1. Coordinate through the space

Time uncoupling is particularly important for coordination, but not so much to search (in real time).

Finally, we can see how the properties commented before interrelate with desirable properties in UbiComp.

Particularly, we can see two negative interrelations:

How can we search in a semantic web provided by limited devices?

(and remember my driving motivation: to promote the direct communication between them)

Devices need to communicate with each other directly, but this cannot be done at any price.

For instance, a broadcasting-based solution will generate a high computation and networking activity.

To find out how these computing and networking activities could affect an embedded platform,

I checked their effects in a FoxG20 embedded device.

???

In periods when it reasons or attends HTTP requests, it consumes approximately 20% more energy.

In other platforms, similar energy wastes can be presumed.

But beyond concrete energy consumptions, what this __chart transmits__ is that since computation and networking result in significant higher energy consumption,
we need to find a strategy which efficiently manages both aspects.

# Roles

<img alt="Roles for the search-architecture: White Page" src="img/transpas/search_roles01.png" style="width: 100%;" class="center" />

???

What __I conceived__ is an architecture which uses "search facilitators" to help nodes to __improve__ their search process.

This "search facilitator", called White Page from now on, is chosen dynamically between all the nodes in a space and can change over the time.

Apart from the White Page role, a node can have two other roles:

 * _Providers_...

and _Consumers_...

<img alt="Roles for the search architecture: Consumers" src="img/transpas/search_roles05.png" style="width: 100%;" class="center" />

.subtitle[

]
<img alt="Devices have different roles at each moment" src="img/transpas/devices_have_roles.png" style="width: 100%;" class="center" />

???

Note that from now to the evaluation, I will talk about roles rather than specific devices.

Each device can select at any time its role: provider, consumer, both or none.

The White Page is selected between all of them.

For instance, from the figure, providing the laptop is steady, it may be chosen as the new WP.

---

# Clues
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_proposal01.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

_Providers_ summarize their knowledge into pieces of information called _clues_.

Note that the solution is based in a principle: _clues do not change frequently_. .weak[principle~=basic rule]

This is possible if they represent the __type__ of information a node hosts rather than the data it constantly generates.

---

# Clues
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_proposal02.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

The White Page stores clues in what it is called an _aggregated clue_.

This _aggregated clue_ is versioned.

In the figure, it has the _i-1_ version.

---

# Clues
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_proposal03.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

Providers send a clue to the WP in any of the following situations:

 1. when a clue is updated
 2. before its lifetime expires
 3. whenever there is a new WP in the Space with a lower setup version than the one in the Provider

---

# Clues
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_proposal04.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

Once the WP receives the new clue, it adds the clue to the _aggregated clue_ creating a new version.

In the figure, version _i_.

---

# Clues
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_proposal05.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

As a response to its request, the providers obtain this aggregated clue version.

The aggregated clues help _Consumers_ searching for information efficiently.

---

# Clues
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_proposal06.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

Therefore, _Consumers_ need to obtain an _aggregated clue_.

This happens in these occasions:

  1. when they don't have one or
  2. periodically
   * this period is adjusted checking the average frequency of its last 10 queries.
   * In any case, this period is bounded with an
   * upper bound time, which ensures a fresh view; and
   * a lower bound time, which avoids flooding to the WP
   
Using these _aggregated clues_, _Consumers_ are able to independently resolve their queries.

---

# Clues
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_proposal07.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

In other words, a _Consumer_ process an _aggregated clue_ to decide to which nodes to ask for information.

Exceptionally, as an optimization for nodes with severe computation restrictions, _Consumers_ can also query the WP which nodes to ask.

---

# Clues
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/search_proposal08.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

# Clue content

<img alt="Semantic example and clue types" src="img/transpas/semanticExample01.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

So, how do a clue look like?

As I mentioned, a clue is a summary of the knowledge hold by a provider.

This knowledge is modelled according to Semantic Web standards.

The Semantic Web is formed by RDF triples.

These triples are composed by a subject, a predicate and an object.

The figure shows an schema of several interrelated triples.

The edges represent the predicates which relate terms with each other.

---

# Clue content
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

<img alt="Semantic example and clue types" src="img/transpas/semanticExample02.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

As a query language for this knowledge, I use wildcard-patterns such as the ones shown at the bottom of the image.
<!-- TODO transpa backup explicando por qué no SPARQL -->

---

# Clue content
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

<img alt="Semantic example and clue types" src="img/transpas/semanticExample03.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

So, to summarize this information, I consider three alternatives:

* Use the __predicates__.
 * They contain the relations between terms.
 * I select just the significant ones.
 * In the example, ssn:observes and ssn:observedBy.

---

# Clue content

* Use the __prefixes__.
 * They indicate the common startings for the URIs used in the triples.
 * They often correspond to vocabularies used by the node to describe the knowledge.
 * In the example, ssn, weather, sweet and ex.

 * They detail types of terms.

# Discovery
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

Using a __discovery mechanism__ each node shares:

1. the __Spaces__ it belongs to,
2. whether it is __White Page__ (+ its setup version)
3. information for the White Page __selection__ process

???

To run my proposal, I require a __discovery mechanism__ able to

1. get the Spaces that a particular node belongs to,
2. identify the WP and its setup version, and
3. provide additional information about nodes to decide which one can be the next WP.

I tested the impact of the discovery mechanism using mDNS and DNS-SD.

However, the specific mechanism used is transversal to the architecture.

---

# White page selection
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/wp_selection01.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

The selection process can start:

First, when no WP is available.

In this case, the first node to realize its absence starts this process.

---

# White page selection
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/wp_selection02.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

???

Second, when the current WP gets a worse score than other nodes.

In this case, it's the current WP the node who checks this periodically.

---

# White page selection
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/wp_selection03.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

And how does the selection work?

The "WP selector" ranks the nodes according to the information provided by their discovery mechanism.

---

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/wp_selection07.png" class="center" style="width:100%;"/>

The goal of this ranking is to move the additional load needed to maintain the architecture to the most __powerful and stable__ device in the space.

# Experimental environment: simulation inputs

]

<img alt="Real time measures" src="img/transpas/device_times.png" style="width: 70%;" class="center" />

???

To test all this architecture, I carried out several simulations.

To parametrize them, I measured the time needed by real platforms to answer to a semantic query.

---

# Experimental environment: simulation inputs
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

* AEMET metereological dataset
* University of Luebeck Wisebed Sensor Readings
* Kno.e.sis Linked Sensor Data

For the data used in the simulation, I extracted them from real datasets.

All these dataset describe sensing stations and their measures.

On the other hand, the querying templates used consider queries from different nature.

-->

???

As a baseline for the comparison, I used the rawest strategy: negative broadcasting.

In this strategy, a node propagates its query to the rest of the nodes it knows about.

As an optimization, a node can memorize which nodes successfully answer the same query in the past.

That is, they can implement caching.

---

# Evaluation: Network activity
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

<img alt="Requests generated using different strategies" src="img/requests_by_strategies.svg" style="width: 90%;" />

???

In the figure we show the results of performing 1.000 queries during one hour for 1 or 100 consumers using each of the strategies explained.
In the proposed solution we can see that an increase in the number of consumers does not increase the number of requests too much.
In fact, the difference between these two cases is found in the additional management tasks.

Comparing it with other solutions, it requires less requests than NB and caching with 100 different consumers.
For the same number of queries, the more consumers there are, the closer to NB caching behaves.

When there is only a consumer in the space, caching works slightly better than our solution.
However, its performance gets closer to our solution as the network size increases.

In other cases, this balance between both strategies will change depending on:

* the number of consumers and
* the number of queries

Unlike in caching, a _Consumer_ using our solution can also give accurate responses the first time it resolves a query.

<!-- NOTA este caso es uno en el que las clues permiten discriminar muy bien, caching es mejor para preguntas que se repiten mucho,

# Evaluation: Network activity (by device type)
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

<img alt="Energy consumption for each class" src="img/transpas/activity_measures.svg" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10%;" />

???

In this chart, we analyse the networking activity generated in each node (on average).

The experiment consists of 300 nodes joined to a Space running on:
 * 1 server,
 * 30 galaxy tabs,
 * 75 FoxG20 and
 * 194 Digi’s XBee sensors


On the left hand side we can see how each device __reduces its activity__ considerably.

On the right hand side, we see two desired effects:

 * the limited devices face less requests and consequently reduce their activity
 * the additional tasks generated by the solution are moved to the more powerful ones

---

# Evaluation: Network activity (high dynamism)
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/evaluation_dynamic.png" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10%;" />

???

Using the same devices as in the previous simulation, this evaluation shows what happens when we have a very dynamic scenario where nodes frequently come and go.
Specifically, it simulates nodes joining and leaving the Space at different intervals .weak[(30 seconds, 1 minute, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 45 minutes)].
We also added an scenario with no drops as a baseline.
.weak[Note that we represent this scenario by configuring the drop-interval with a greater value than the simulation time.]

Furthermore, the evaluation tests the most harmful situation: the node __abruptly leaving__ the Space __is__ always the __WP__.

In the left hand side, we see how in the worse case scenario, our solution is far below NB.

In the right hand side, we see an increase of about 13.000 requests for the most frequent drop-interval simulation.
This happens because providers are forced to send their individual clues to many new WPs.

However, once the aggregated clues have been propagated to most of the consumers (in this case at 5 minutes drop interval),
the new WP can be initiated from a previous aggregated clue version.
This avoids the situation when most of the providers re-send their clues over and over.

---

# Summary
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture
]

The presented search architecture cares about _computation_ (C) and _energy_ (E), because:

 * Management __tasks are delegated__ to the most powerful devices in the space (C+E)
 * The search is improved avoiding many __unnecessary requests__ (C+E)
 * If the _Provider_ __cannot process__ the _aggregated clue_, it can delegate it on the WP (C)
 * The WP selection process prioritizes cases where __less providers__ are forced to __resend__ their last clue version (E).

???

The presented search architecture cares about __computation__ and __energy__, because:

 * The additional management tasks created are delegated to one of the most powerful devices in the space (C+E)
 * The search is improved avoiding many unnecessary requests (C+E)
 * If the _Provider_ cannot processing the _aggregated clue_, it can delegate it on the WP (C)
 * The WP selection process prioritizes cases where __less providers__ are forced to __resend__ their last clue version (E).
  1. gives priority to the nodes which has an updated version of the _aggregated clue_
  2. gives priority to steady nodes so the new WP will not presumably be replaced in a long time (E)

#Summary
.subtitle[
## Energy-aware search architecture

<img alt="Energy consumption for each type of activity" src="img/energy_consumption.svg" style="width: 80%;" class="center" />

???

Note that in the simulation, the energy has been measured indirectly through the computation and networking activity.

Using the time needed for each activity, we could estimate energy losses thanks to evaluations equivalent to the one presented for the FoxG20 platform.

To obtain a more precise energy consumption view, measures in a real running scenarios could be considered.

Specifically, the idea I present here is currently in its early stages and still has to be fully developed.

The first one is the __replicated-worker pattern__.

In this pattern, there is a master process and many worker processes able to compute the same task.

---

# Patterns for Tuple Spaces
.subtitle[

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/ts_patterns03.png" style="width: 100%;" />

process it and as a result activate the blades.

Then, it may write a result in the space that the "activator node" will read.

For example, with information about when it was turned on.

This approach has been widely applied in the literature.
In the past, this idea evolved into service-oriented engines.
.weak[The task-types where described through services and task through _service invocations_.]

In fact, in the early stages of my PhD, I also explored this approach.

However, the more I read about WoT, the more I liked its simplicity.

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/hypermedia_driven01.png" style="width: 100%;" />

To make the API hypermedia-driven, the application has to describe the current state and the transitions to the next ones.

This way, the client can select the next state of the application through hypermedia.

When the client is a human, it is trivial for him to interpret the HTML content and decide which link to follow or which button to press.

Let's assume that there is only one path (or no path).

This path will contain different steps composed by the rules which need to be invoked to obtain a plan.

And since these rules are composed by the HTTP requests, we just have to check if we can invoke them.

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/hypermedia_driven02.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

In short, machines can learn how to use an API autonomously using RESTdesc.

That is, RESTdesc becomes APIs hypermedia-driven.

The main advantage of an hypermedia-driven API is that it can change its _shape_ over the time and the applications automatically consuming it will not need to be reconfigured or redeveloped.

Translating it to the WoT field, it will allow to act using actuators not known at the design or implementation phases.

We can also see in the table how each of them require additional features:

* A subscription mechanism in the case of space-based computing.
 This mechanism helps nodes to be aware of what is written into the space without constantly polling it.
* A reasoner to create a execution plan,


So I made myself the following question: could space-based computing take advantage of these existing REST-based actuators?

Furthermore, could this reuse be made in a seamless way for nodes already following each of these techniques?

# Driving scenario

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/actuation_scenario.png" style="width: 100%;" />

???

As a first step to answer this question, I planned a baseline scenario and implemented it using both mechanisms.

The scenario is the "helloworld" of the scenarios: turning on and off a light.

However, it helps to understand both actuation mechanisms and test the interoperation ideas.

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/requests_by_techniques.svg" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 5%;" />

???

After implementing both scenarios, I calculated how the variation in the number of providers (e.g., actuators) could affect these techniques.

First, we can see that as the amount of actuators increases, both techniques generate more requests.
The slope will vary depending on the design (and implementation) of each solution.
In any case, the figure shows that none of the techniques behave in a scalable manner.

In the case of space-based actuation, the variation corresponds to the subscription request of each actuator and two additional writings it does. <!-- FIXME comprobar que es así -->

In the case of REST-based actuation the crawler needs to obtain 5 different rules for each actuator.

In the chart, we see that the amount of actuators affects more severely to __REST__-based actuation.

This is due to the to the reasoning process which takes place in the node which generates the plan.

In __space__-based actuation, most of the time is spent checking subscriptions at each write.

Note that even if the subscription mechanism was unoptimized due to its prototyping nature, it made space-based actuation scale much better.

The table shows how the providers in the second actuation mechanism are more lightweight.

That is, they just attend to the request received using HTTP.

Probably as a consequence of these few requirements, exposing the actuation capabilities of the limited devices with HTTP is a consolidated trend.
.weak[This tendency is backed by the WoT initiative.]

REST-desc only requires devices to additionally provide their API's resources' descriptions.

This can be done before deploying them and does not affect to their usual operation.

# Interoperation

With these considerations in mind, I propose a solution which completely reuses the nodes implemented for the previous actuation techniques.

In the left hand side, we see a master node from Space-based actuation which writes the "turn light on" task.

This API is described using RESTdesc.

Therefore, the space needs to be extended to make their interoperability possible.

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/mixed_actuation04.png" style="width: 100%;" />

And... how is it extended?

The space will be responsible of:

* Translating a _subscription to a task result_ into a reasoning goal.
 Considering the how I implemented the subscriptions .weak[(based on SPARQL using RDFLib)], this is a straightforward syntactic translation .weak[(from SPARQL to N3QL for EYE)].

---

# Interoperation: how?
.subtitle[

<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/mixed_actuation05.png" style="width: 100%;" />

Apart from this, it will be in charge of two tasks performed by the client in REST-based actuation:

 * crawl APIs to obtain RESTdesc rules and

---

# Interoperation: how?
.subtitle[
## Actuation
]
<img alt="XXX" src="img/transpas/mixed_actuation06.png" style="width: 100%;" />
???

 * create a plan.

Note one benefitial aspect: as the process resides in the same machine as the space, it can locally read all the content written into the space.

This content is provided as additional knowledge to the reasoning process.

This way, we avoid additional costly networking operations (both in bandwidth and in time) to obtain this knowledge.

---

# Discussion
.subtitle[
## Actuation
]

Further investigation with more complex scenarios is needed:

* Is the __translation__ between the subscriptions and the goal always possible?
* If the plan has __2 or more paths__ to achieve a goal, which one should we chose?
* What if __two different actuators__ from space-based and rest-based actuation can be activated?

???

However, the hybrid-actuation technique presented needs further investigation to ensure its universality.

For example,

* Would the translation between the subscriptions and the goal always be possible?
 .weak[What if the node initiating the change does not subscribe to any result?]

* If there are two or more paths to reach a goal, how can we discern which one to follow?
 .weak[This problem is specific to the REST actuation using REST-desc.]

* How does the middleware deal with the coexistence of both mechanisms?
 When both methods can be applied, which one is triggered?
 .weak[Which one prevails over the other?]


In any case, I analysed actuation in space-based computing from a novel-point of view.

From the space-based consumer perspective, I proposed to seamlessly reuse actuators from the WoT.

To conclude, let me present my contributions and conclusions.

# Hypothesis

???

First, let me start checking how I have given an answer to the hypothesis.

# Hypothesis

 > The alignment of the __TSC paradigm__ with the __web's principles__ together with the
 > consideration of its __energy and computational impact__, leads to UbiComp
 > environments where heterogeneous devices communicate autonomously in an uncoupled
 > and interoperable fashion.

???

This three elements have guided my dissertation:

 * The semantic space-based paradigm called Triple Space Computing (TSC)
 * Its alignment with the web
 * The consideration of limited devices needs regarding their energy and computation constraints.

---

# Hypothesis

 > The alignment of the TSC paradigm with the web's principles together with the
 > consideration of its energy and computational impact, leads to UbiComp
 > environments where heterogeneous devices communicate __autonomously__ in an uncoupled
 > and interoperable fashion.

???

As a result, I wanted to check that the devices could communicate autonomously in an uncoupled and interoperable fashion.


The __autonomy__ is reached through the web-based dual space model presented.

This model has a federated space formed by the _sub-spaces_ where devices manage their own semantic data.

To help them searching in such space, I have designed a dynamic architecture which

* promotes end-to-end search between devices and
* considers their energy and computation capabilities.

Besides, the mixed actuation technique presented reduces even more the requirements for an actuator to belong to my space model.

Now, actuators already exposing their capabilities through an HTTP API, only need to annotate it semantically to enable their reuse through the space.

---

# Hypothesis

 > The alignment of the TSC paradigm with the web's principles together with the
 > consideration of its energy and computational impact, leads to UbiComp
 > environments where heterogeneous devices communicate autonomously in an __uncoupled__
 > and interoperable fashion.

???

Regarding the __uncoupling__, all the communication between the devices is driven by the data.

On top of the space, there is no need to refer to concrete addresses.

Furthermore, the model also contemplates a more classical space that devices can use to coordinate with each other in a time uncoupled way.

---

# Hypothesis

 > The alignment of the TSC paradigm with the web's principles together with the
 > consideration of its energy and computational impact, leads to UbiComp
 > environments where heterogeneous devices communicate autonomously in an uncoupled
 > and __interoperable__ fashion.

???

Finally, I have dealt with the __interoperability__:

1. using the semantic web to promote data reuse and the web to use a widely accepted exchange mechanism; and
1. analysing how to reuse a novel and true REST-based actuation technique from the space-based computing perspective.

* From my experience, nowadays there are __not many__ embedded or mobile devices able to manage the semantic web successfully.
 * However, recent works on lightweight reasoning, communication protocols or semantic formats, can __considerably reduce__ the computing requirements needed.
* The second is that I have the impression that we sometimes __look down on__ interoperability.
 * .weak[Causes: impossibility to perceive its benefits in the short term and privacy concerns]
 * However, the __Linked Data__ initiative is slowly changing this perception.
* Finally, although __REST-like__ architectures are very popular nowadays, the need of making them hypermedia-driven is not shared by many web developers.
 * And this is a pity, because otherwise __using__ third-party web applications' __automatically__ would be much closer.
 * .weak[Razonamiento: in this case, the industry will put pressure on the academia {akadimia}]

# Hypothesis: some definitions

  * Heterogeneity: Fully-fledged computers and resource constrained devices (e.g., mobile and embedded devices) must coexist in these environments.
  * Autonomy: Devices must not depend on others to consume or provide data on their behalf.
  However, they might be aided by other devices to complete some related tasks (e.g., search the appropriate nodes to request).
  * Uncoupling: The communication must be data-driven.
  From the user perspective devices do not directly refer to each other.
  Additionally, the provider and the consumer should not coexist in time.
  However, note that since this sub-aspect contradicts the autonomy principle, their selection might be left to the user.
  * Interoperability: Devices must be able to exchange information with other systems and to use that information.

In the following chart we show the type of communication for an scenario with 100 consumers and different network sizes.

It shows that most of the requests are from consumers to providers.

Therefore, maintaining the architecture does not creates much overhead and it does not increase much with the number of consumers.

# Evaluation: Discovery mechanism

* Use of mDNS and DNS-SD.
* TXT record changes
 1. when a new WP is selected
 2. when we update the time elapsed since it joined the Space and its battery charge level

* In the most static scenario the TXT record is written only once.
* In the more dynamic one, it updates that record 126 times after writing it for the first time.

???

This demonstrates that the overhead generated on the discovery system by our solution is minimal even in the worst-case scenario.
