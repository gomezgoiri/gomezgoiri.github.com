# Motivation
<!--## (1/6)-->

# Motivation

 1. Space-based computing
 1. Ubiquitous computing (UbiComp)

<img alt="UbiComp and Space based computing" src="img/ubicomp_space.svg" style="width: 100%; display: block; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" />

???

I'm not talking about the pragmatic motivation, which is to get a PhD ;-)

2 fields influenced me.

---

# Space-based computing
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

 * Space uncoupling
 * Time uncoupling

<img alt="Space based computing: rd, in and out primitives" src="img/spacebasedcomp.svg" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" />

???

 * Ideal for environments which change (in short and long time)
 
---

<!-- Molaría más tener un supertítulo en pequeño para que se notase que sigo en la motivation -->
# UbiComp
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

Devices imperceptibly working on our behalf.

 * Its real power "_comes not from any one of these devices, it emerges from the __interaction__ of all of them_".
 * The Internet of Things and mobile computing.

???

UbiComp is a term __coined__ by Mark Weiser (in the early nineties).

Lately: IoT & mobile comp. __contributed to this vision__.

## Problem
Devices and applications build upon them are heterogeneous.

---

# Interoperability
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]

The IEEE defines it as

 > The ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information
 > and to use the information that has been exchanged. <!-- TODO cite -->
 
---

# Interoperability

<img alt="Interoperability: exchange and use" src="img/interoperability.svg" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-top: 2em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" />


???
 1. Rely on widely accepted communication protocols (interop __ab-initio__)

 1. Syntactic level: format of the data (i.e. its syntax and encoding)
 1. Semantic level: precise meaning of the info
 
  * _"understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose"_ <!-- TODO cite -->

# The Semantic Web
.subtitle[
## Motivation
]


 > .weak[The vision of the Semantic Web is to extend principles of the Web from documents to data.
 > Data should be accessed using the general Web architecture using, e.g., URI-s;
 > data should be __related to one another__ just as documents (or portions of documents) are already.
 > This also means creation of a common framework that allows data
 > to be __shared and reused__ across application, enterprise, and community boundaries,
 > to be __processed automatically__ by tools as well as manually,
 > including revealing possible __new relationships__ among pieces of data.]

???

After analyzing these research areas...

Space-based computing:
 * Often applied to UbiComp
 * Used with Semantics

Usually centrallizing so...

I made myself a question (research question, PhD opportunity)

 * Can these devices get more involved in the management of the space?
   ( more involved == Not only mere clients )

  * Semantic in limited devices __Overhead__?
    * Many of the current devices are able to manage their info
     * Even if it is more verbosed
     * Some of them can even autonomously reason and expand this information.
    * Other may need to rely in third entities.
    * In any case, we can anticipate a trend.

Let me sketch some of this points in the remaining minutes.
 
For the sake of time, I omit the 3rd one and explain the rest summarized.

# Space model

???

This is __simplified version__ of all my unfruitful attempts.

---

# Baseline Model
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

Triple Space Computing (TSC)
 
 * Spaces identified by URIs
 * Tuples == RDF Triples & RDF Graphs
 * Templates = triple patterns

???

Uses elements from the SW

---

# 1st attempt
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

Completely decentralized

 * Each device manages its own information
 * It asks to the rest (P2P)

???

I did this prior to knowing that I wanted to be a PhD student.

Benefits:

 * Avoids depending on others: simplify management
  * each device manages its own knowledge
 * Reduces networking in writings
  * Which are quite frequent (updates of a sensor measure)

Drawbacks:

 * Flooding: networking
 * Inconsistency (Brewer)
 * JXTA: not really interoperable
 
  * Not appropriate for limited devices
  * Discontinued
  * A nightmare!

# 2nd attempt (I)
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

Same model, we substituted the _communication mechanism_
???
To interoperate, it is better to adopt a widely accepted mechanism.

<!-- Mechanism/protocol -->

<h2 style="margin-top:5em;">the Web!</h2>]

???

Even this presentation is part of the web!

(at least, it is running in a web browser and it will be uploaded afterwards ;-))

# Why the Web?
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

 * Massively accepted <!--by humans.-->
 * A lot of applications expose their capabilities using HTTP APIs
--

 * __REST__ architectural style comprises the design principles of _the modern web_

<!--  Dibujito o tabla para que se intuya? -->

???

 Properties achieved:
 
  * Scalability
  * Simplicity
  * Portability
  * etc.
 
 They are useful for limited devices!
 
--

 * Actually, it has been widely applied to IoT: the __Web of Things__

# 2nd attempt (II)
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

HTTP API for TSC:

 * __Resource oriented__: spaces, RDF Graphs, RDF triples
 
 * HTTP __verbs__ mapped to TSC __primitives__
 
 * Other features: status codes, content negotiation, etc.
 
 * It is not hypermedia driven (yet)

<!--enumerar los principios que cumple-->

???

As part of this 2nd attempt... we made an HTTP API

TSC interface for HTTP compatible with (most of) the REST principles.

HATEOAS: future work.

* Although it has a human oriented API


Drawback not mentioned yet:

 * subscription, transactions, etc. vs stateless

# Problem with the 1st and 2nd attempts
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

What about the uncoupling?
 
 
 <img alt="Space and time" src="img/uncoupling.svg" style="width:90%; margin-top: 2em; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"" class="center" />

--
 
<span style="margin-left: 1.4em;">Space uncoupling <span style="color: #4db849; font-size: 2em; vertical-align: middle;">&#10004;</span></span>
???

 * You can substitute devices in the space
 * You don't need to configure the space
  * Programmers only care about data (forced by the primitives)

--

<span style="float:right;">Time uncoupling <span style="color: #e53f39; font-size: 1.5em; vertical-align: middle;">&#10060;</span></span>

???

 * Provider holds its content...
  * only accessible when the provider is available
  * it is __unreliable__
 * Subscriptions => difficult (i.e. more networking)
 * Move contents to other nodes
  * how to distinguish the reliable ones?
  * measures away from where they are generated
   * what if the other node lefts the space but the provider is available?
 * Replicate contents
  * more networking
  * not easy (unreliable => networking)

---

# Final model
.subtitle[
## Space model
]

We realized that we used the space for different purposes:

 1. Search for information
 1. Coordinate through the space

--

<img alt="Proposed dual model" src="img/new_model.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

<!-- A modo de evaluación o conclusión, poner una tabla con las propiedades -->

???

Based on our experience.

Hence, we propose a dual model.
 * Coordination space
 * Outer space: enhanced by the information provided by autonomous devices

# Evaluation: Energy consumption

<img alt="Energy consumption for each type of activity" src="img/energy_consumption.svg" style="width: 90%;" />

???

 1. Improve the search, become it smarter
 1. Move the management tasks created by our proposal to more powerful devices

---

class: center, middle

<img alt="Energy-aware search architecture" src="img/architecture.svg" style="width: 100%;" />

???

 * WP to enhance the search
  * WP chosen dynamically: considering energy consumption and computation
  * changes over the time
 * End-to-end
  * Consumers directly ask to providers
  * Don't depend on the WP to resolve the queries
   * Just to get and update the clues
