Ubiquitous Computing is characterized by heterogeneous devices of a dynamic nature.
So far, semantics and space-based computing have been widely applied to cope with both aspects.
However, the integration of these devices with the web has gained momentum in the last years.
Therefore, the seamless reuse of these web-enabled devices drastically increases the actuation possibilities of any application.
This paper explores how semantic space-based applications can perform the aforementioned reuse.
This exploration is guided by the implementation of a scenario.
The scenario shows a neat interoperation between nodes from both worlds: space-based computing and the web.
In addition, the generalization of the proposed solution poses new challenges to be tackled.
