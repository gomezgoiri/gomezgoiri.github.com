Distributed architectures mean signiﬁcant beneﬁts
for many scenarios.
However, they also entail difﬁculties and
problems because of their intrinsic nature.
Moreover, these
environments don’t support any semantics by themselves,
becoming necessary the implementation of additional solutions
for knowledge representation and management.
As a result,
new troubles arise, as integration and management related.
This work proposes the use of a Triple Spaces solution for
integrating any semantic and distributed environment.
Particulary, it outlines how two very different scenarios have been
implemented under the Triple Spaces paradigm.
