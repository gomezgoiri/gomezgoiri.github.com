In the Internet of Things several objects with network capabilities are connected over a self-configured local network with other objects to interact and share knowledge.
In this context, the Triple Space approach, where different processes share common semantic knowledge, seems to fit perfectly.
In this paper we present our progress towards a semantic middleware which allows the communication between a wide range of embedded devices in a distributed, decoupled and very expressive manner.
This solution has been tested in a stereotypical deployment scenario showing the promising potential of this approach for local environments.
