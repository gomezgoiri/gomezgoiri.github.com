Recent trends in online learning, most notably Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Learning Analytics, are changing the landscape in the education sector by offering learners with access to free learning materials of high quality, as well as with the means to monitor their progress and reflect on their learning experiences.
This part presents FORGE, a European initiative for online learning and experimentation via interactive learning resources.
FORGE provides learners and educators with access to world-class experimentation facilities and high quality learning materials.
Additionally, the deployment of Learning Analytics in the FORGE learning resources aims at supporting awareness and reflection both for learners and educators.
