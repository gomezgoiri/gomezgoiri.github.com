The Internet of Things (IoT) enables communication among real-world things and devices through Internet.
So far, IoT research has focused on allowing such communication through different protocols and architectures.
Some of these architectural approaches are Web of Things (WoT) and Triple Space (TS) which are both resource oriented architectures.
This work analyses and compares both approaches and outlines the scenarios in which they will be more useful.
Particularly, it outlines how some of the drawbacks of WoT in the discovery and cooperation aspects may be complemented by integrating with TS.
