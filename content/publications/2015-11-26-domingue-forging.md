The FIRE initiative (Future Internet Research and Experimentation) creates an open research environment that facilitates strategic research and development of new Future Internet concepts, giving researchers the tools they need to conduct large-scale experiments on new paradigms. The FORGE project introduces the FIRE experimental facilities to the eLearning community, in order to promote experimentally driven research in education by using experiments as an interactive learning and training channel both for students and professionals.

This book introduces a range of Future Internet topics using FIRE facilities. You will have the opportunity to study in depth various aspects of networking protocols and infrastructure, watch instructional movies and screencasts, as well as conduct experiments using the FIRE infrastructure.
