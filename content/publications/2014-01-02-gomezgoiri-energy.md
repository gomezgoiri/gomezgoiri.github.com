Nowadays, not only computers or mobile phones are connected to the Internet but also other devices like cars or washing machines.
In this way, these devices can form an Ambient Intelligence environment where they can share and provide information.
The integration of such devices is difficult as they normally use different protocols.
To overcome this problem, the Web of Things (WoT) initiative proposes to use well-established web standards to ease their communication.
However, these devices still need to share data in different formats.
For this reason, it is convenient to annotate data semantically in the WoT.
Working with annotated data is expensive for devices which usually have limited capacity.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic architecture to search semantically annotated data in the WoT.
This architecture takes into account the reduced computation capacity and the limited energy autonomy of embedded devices.
