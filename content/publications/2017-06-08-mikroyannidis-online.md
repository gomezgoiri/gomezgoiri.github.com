This paper presents a case study on teaching network engineering in conjunction with interactive learning resources.
This case study has been developed in collaboration with the Cisco Networking Academy in the context of the FORGE project, which promotes online learning and experimentation by offering access to virtual and remote labs. The main goal of this work is allowing learners and educators to perform network simulations within a web browser or an interactive eBook by using any type of mobile, tablet or desktop device.
Learning Analytics are employed in order to monitor learning behaviour for further analysis of the learning experience offered to students.
