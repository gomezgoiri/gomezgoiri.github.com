The aim of this project is to provide a set of methods, tools and technical solutions that support migrating towards advanced service oriented development models, having in mind methodological, technological and business aspects. Thus, mCloud will help to increase Spanish software companies' competitiveness by giving them tools to progress towards the Internet of Services where applications will mainly be deployed on the Cloud.
