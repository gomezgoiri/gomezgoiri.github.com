The aim of the TALIS+ENGINE: Cooperative and Semantic Hybrid Reasoning for Service Orchestration in Reactive Environments subproject is to advance in the automatic or semi-automatic service composition within assistive environments with the goal of allowing in a spontaneous manner the environment adaptation to the concrete needs and goals of the user. Such adaptation of environment’s behaviour demands the adoption of cooperative, hybrid (symbolic and connectionist), adaptable and scalable (evolving being aware of the emerging and disappearing devices and their sensing and acting capabilities) intelligence techniques.
