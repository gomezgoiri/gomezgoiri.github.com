Forging Online Education through FIRE (FORGE) is a project bringing the FIRE and eLearning worlds together.
FORGE will align FIRE (Future Internet Research and Experimentation) with the ongoing education revolution.
This project will specify development methodologies and best practices for offering FIRE experimentation facilities to learners and to the learning community in general.
FORGE relates to communications and IT, as well as to other disciplines including the physical and social sciences.
It will lead to a strong connection between the learning community and existing FIRE platforms and supporting tools.
