I designed and developed several projects where Internet connectivity was provided to industrial equipment (e.g. press machines, weighing scales or remote controls). The webapps I built let customers monitor their equipment, actuate over it and exploit the data they send to guarantee their correct maintenance.

  - Data visualizations in Single-page applications using _React_ and _Redux_. Interaction with devices using websockets and MQTT protocol.
  - Web APIs using _AWS API Gateway_ or _Springboot_ and integrating several authentication services.
  - Data ingest using _Spark structured streaming_, _Apache Kafka_ and _AWS Lambda functions_.
  - Storage using both relational and NoSQL databases like _PostgreSQL_, _DynamoDB_ o _InfluxDB_.
  - Automated deployment using Serverless framework, Maven and Docker containers.
