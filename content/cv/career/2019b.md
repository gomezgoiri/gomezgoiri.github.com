I designed and developed several decentralized applications for a range of projects where blockchain (or more generally _distributed ledger_) technologies were used to ensure an immutable, agreed and shared state between untrusted parties.

- Smart-contracts for [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) with Solidity.
- √êApps in Javascript.
