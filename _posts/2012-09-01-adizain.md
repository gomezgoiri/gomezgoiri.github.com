This project's main objective is the development of a industrial solution of a Unified Control Centre.
This centre helps to centralize the management of different commercial multi-vendor security devices (e.g., people counters or video cameras).

The resulting system has the following features:

 * __Modular design__: it is organized in several OSGi modules which talk to each other through declarative services.
 * __Distributed, decoupled and scalable design__: it uses queues  (ActiveMQ) for the inter-OSGi container communication and a NoSQL database (MongoDB).
 * __Customizable and interactive user experience__: it relies on a rule-based reasoning framework to generate alerts and events on a web interface based on MQTT, Javascript and HTML5.
