[Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/about-networking-academy/packet-tracer/) is a network simulation tool created by [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/).
As part of the [FORGE project](projects/forge.html), I developed a web version/frontend for it.


However, despite of the simplicity of the user interface, the architecture which lies behind is not simple at all.
In this article, I will briefly explain the different parts of the architecture.
For more information on how they were made or how they look like, go to next sections.
